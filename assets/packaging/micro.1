.SH DESCRIPTION

Micro is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the full capabilities
of modern terminals. It comes as one single, batteries-included, static binary with no dependencies.

As the name indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a successor to the nano editor by being easy to install and use in a pinch, but micro also aims to be
enjoyable to use full time, whether you work in the terminal because you prefer it (like me), or because you need to (over ssh).

Use Ctrl-q to quit, Ctrl-s to save, and Ctrl-g to open the in-editor help menu.

.SH CONFIGURATION

Micro uses $MICRO_CONFIG_HOME as the configuration directory.
If this environment variable is not set, it uses $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/micro instead.
If that environment variable is not set, it uses ~/.config/micro as the configuration directory.
In the documentation, we use ~/.config/micro to refer to the configuration directory
(even if it may in fact be somewhere else if you have set either of the above environment variables).

.SH NOTICE
This manpage is intended only to serve as a quick guide to the invocation of 
micro and is not intended to replace the full documentation included with micro
which can be accessed from within micro. Micro tells you what key combination to
press to get help in the lower right.

.SH BUGS
A comprehensive list of bugs will not be listed in this manpage. See the Github
page at \fBhttps://github.com/zyedidia/micro/issues\fP for a list of known bugs
and to report any newly encountered bugs you may find. We strive to correct
bugs as swiftly as possible.
